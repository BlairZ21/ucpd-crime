<p>We reviewed UCPD daily incident logs from January 2010 to September 2015. To analyze crime by incident type, we classified incident descriptions into three categories: violent crime, such as assault and robbery; property crime, such as theft and vandalism; and quality-of-life crime, such as alcohol and drug violations. We attempted to follow the FBI's <a target="_blank" href="https://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/about/offense_definitions.html">Uniform Crime Reporting standards</a>, but the classification involved judging how to categorize some crime types.</p>

<p>Many of the logged events were security checks, alarms or escorts, which we excluded from our analysis.</p>
