<p>We filed a California Public Records Act request with UCPD for incident-level crime data and reviewed daily incident logs from January 2010 to September 2015. </p>

<p>To analyze crime by incident type, we created a mapping of incident descriptions from the raw data (such as &ldquo;VANDALISM&rdquo;) to one of three categories: violent crime, such as assault and robbery, property crime, such as theft and vandalism, and quality-of-life crime, such as alcohol and drug violations. You can view the mapping <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sahilchinoy/ucpd-crime/blob/master/data/classification.csv">here</a>. The classification involved subjective judgement about to which category a particular crime type belongs.</p>

<p>Many of the logged events were security checks, alarms or escorts. We excluded those incidents from our analysis. In all, we analyzed 9,204 of the 28,138 reports.</p>

<p>The data contains a location field &mdash; sometimes an address, but often an abbreviation, such as &ldquo;BAN/TELE&rdquo; for the intersection of Bancroft Way and Telegraph Avenue, or a commonly-used name, such as &ldquo;GRINNELL PATH.&rdquo; To put these incidents on a map, we had to assign each point a latitude and longitude.</p>

<p>Because geocoding services don't recognize many of these canonical names, we had to manually construct a mapping of incident locations to latitude and longitude, which you can view <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sahilchinoy/ucpd-crime/blob/master/data/addresses.csv">here</a>. After manually checking the list, we were able to geocode 8,175 incidents, 7,643 of which were close to campus.</p>

<p>The data and code used for this project is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sahilchinoy/ucpd-crime">available to the public</a>.</p>
